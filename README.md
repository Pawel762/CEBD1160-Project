## Research Question

Can we determine the Hue based on the other caracteristics?

### Abstract

The wine dataset is composed of 13 different characteristics. The wines in this dataset are from 3 different regions. Some of the properties, I known. Other ones are chemicals that I never heard. I wanted to build a model that will predict the hue based on the other properties.
My starting point was the “scipy cheat sheet” https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/ 
By process of elimination it led me to use linear regression model with fit.

### Introduction

Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about the dataset. Can copy from elsewhere, but cite the source (i.e. at least link, and explicitly say if it's copied from elsewhere).

### Methods

Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about how you decided to approach solving it. Include:

- pseudocode for this method (either created by you or cited from somewhere else)
- why you chose this method

### Results

Brief (2 paragraph) description about your results. Include:

- At least 1 figure
- At least 1 "value" that summarizes either your data or the "performance" of your method
- A short explanation of both of the above

### Discussion
Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about what you did. Include:

- interpretation of whether your method "solved" the problem
- suggested next step that could make it better.

### References
